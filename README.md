# The CYK Algorithm
The Cocke–Younger–Kasami (CYK) parsing algorithm determines if a given word w ∈ L(G) for a language L generated by a grammar G in Chomsky Normal Form.

```
let the input be a string I consisting of n characters: a1 ... an.
let the grammar contain r nonterminal symbols R1 ... Rr, with start symbol R1.
let P[n,n,r] be an array of booleans. Initialize all elements of P to false.
let back[n,n,r] be an array of lists of backpointing triples. Initialize all elements of back to the empty list.

for each s = 1 to n
    for each unit production Rv → as
        set P[1,s,v] = true

for each l = 2 to n -- Length of span
    for each s = 1 to n-l+1 -- Start of span
        for each p = 1 to l-1 -- Partition of span
            for each production Ra    → Rb Rc
                if P[p,s,b] and P[l-p,s+p,c] then
                    set P[l,s,a] = true, 
                    append <p,b,c> to back[l,s,a]

if P[n,1,1] is true then
    I is member of language
    return back -- by retracing the steps through back, one can easily construct all possible parse trees of the string.
else
    return "not a member of language"

# Setup

Install Python by following the directions at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Acquire the project locally by cloning it using the below git command.
```
git clone https://github.com/austinpkugler/cyk.git
```
Alternatively, download the `.zip` file by clicking the green "Code" dropdown and selecting "Download ZIP." Extract the `.zip` once it is downloaded.

Navigate to the project's `cyk/` parent directory and run the project using the below command.
```
python3 run.py
```

# Using the Project

Once run, you will be prompted to enter a given CNF grammar G and word w. CYK parsing is applied to these inputs and the results displayed. Errors are displayed for any invalid input.

# Example

Here is an example of the parser in action.

```
Enter a CNF grammar G followed by an input word w. Terminals should be lowercase and nonterminals uppercase. Whitespace does not matter.

Examples:
G = S -> AB|BC, A -> BA|a, B -> CC|b, C -> AB|a
w = babaa

G = S -> AB|BC, A -> SA|a, B -> BB|b
w = ababb

G = S -> AB, A -> a, B -> b
w = ba

-----------------------------------------------
G = S -> AB|BC, A -> BA|a, B -> CC|b, C -> AB|a
w = babaa

Grammar:
S -> AB|BC
A -> BA|a
B -> CC|b
C -> AB|a
Alphabet:
{'b', 'a'}
Word:
babaa
Parse Table:
      b                  a                  b                  a                  a                  
b     {'B'}              {'S', 'A'}         {'C', 'S'}         {'B'}              {'S', 'A'}         
a     {'C', 'A'}         {'C', 'S'}         {'B'}              {'S', 'A'}         
b     {'B'}              {'S', 'A'}         
a     {'C', 'A'}         {'B'}              
a     {'C', 'A'}         
Results:
w ∈ L(G) for the given w and G
The word is in the language generated by the grammar.
```
